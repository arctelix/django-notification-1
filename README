This application lets you notify users of events.

Simple user case:

1. Create notification types in your database, in the management.py
    # FIXME show here how to do this
2. Make some users observe the notification_type you created from some emitter
    # FIXME show here how to do this
3. Send the notifications to users who are observing the sender.
    # FIXME show here how to do this
4. Change the templates for each notification type to send personalized
    notifications.
    # FIXME show here how to do this
5. Display the notifications to the user
    # FIXME show here how to do this
