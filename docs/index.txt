configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality. This
includes:

 * Submission of notification messages by other apps & objects.
 * Automated Notification settings view.
 * Automated Notification settings view for each type of observed object.
 * Automated Notification messages with Automated hyperlink integration.
 * Automated Notification message modifiaction for observed objects.
 * Optional Notification Queueing.
 * Optional Notification Treading.
 * Pluggable backends (configureable by user):
   - Notification messages via website.
   - Notification messages via email.
